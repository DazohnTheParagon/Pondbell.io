    <h2> The catalyst</h2>
    <h3> A hidden talent</h3>
    <p> I recall being on a PlayStation party with
        a buddy of mine joking about how cheesy teen
        dramas on tv were. I quickly improvised the movie
        trailer of a show I joked I would pitch to a channel
        like the CW. I quickly rattled off who the characters
        would be, what their names were, and what the inciting
        incident was. My friend's laughter quickly faded to intrigue.
        It wasn't until I had finished my rambling that one of them had spoken up and said
        "Man I'm not joking you should actually do that" I at first assumed
        he was doing a bit but he assured me he wasn't and that he genuinely
        believed that I was onto something. I dismissed the idea as I already had a hobby which
        was making music and at the time I couldn't even entertain the idea of
        making an actual story that could possibly disrupt my already chaotic high school life.</p>

        <h2> The push </h2>
        <h3>How Pondbell came to be</h3>
        <p> I had gotten kicked out of my home and decided to move up to Michigan.
            I hadn't much money to my name and not many real-life friends to ease my burden.
            In a room no larger than the bathroom I currently had and not much of a career to speak of.
            I decided I would tune into my favorite form of disassociation, television. Tv had
            always intrigued me but most important was the way that watching TV had always made me feel. 
            When watching films like  <span class="movie"> "Black Swan" </span> I'd had to remind myself to breathe and had to pause the movie
            at points so that i could regain my composure. Films like <span class="movie"> "Raid Redemtion" </span> had taught me 
            to take my martial arts training more seriously. Films like <span class="movie"> "500 Days of summer" </span> had allowed me to
            finally, see women as human beings and not some trophy to be won at the end of my "grand quest". These
            films change the way I viewed the world and the way I thought. So imagine the horror I felt when
            trying to find something to watch or when watching the most recent films at the time
            and noticing I hadn't felt my heart beating out of my chest, or my limbs twitching in response to
            a fast-paced fight scene, or the introspection I'd undertake due to a particularly thought-provoking film.
            I needed to do something, anything. And there I was sat in front of an empty google word doc.
            I'd begun writing and the words just wouldn't seem to stop flowing from me.
            I had corrected every trope I so despised and placed my own spin on it. Overtly sexualized high schoolers?
            Place them in college and give them age-appropriate partners. Characters suffering from mental disorders
            being treated as comic relief or the villain? Give them nuances that make them feel real and fleshed out,
            make them a character that just so happens to have a disorder not a walking talking caricature of a disorder.
            Lack of diversity? Look at many of the characters you have created and give them a random race. If having their race change
            alters the direction of your story alter the story to fit that character's race. Stereotypes? Have healthy representation and
            ensure that you're informed on the many ways in which people of color or those of the LGBTQ+ community are often misrepresented, 
            step out of the box and understand that they are people before they are gay, straight, black, or Asian. Speak to those around you to understand their experiences
            and loosely base your character's experiences and responses on them. I was able to do this and in doing so I received glowing reviews from
            those who test read my novel</p>

            <h2> Now </h2> 
            <h3>Pondbells successes</h3>
            <p> The book has garnered hundreds of reads on Wattpad and other reading apps. I have a small but dedicated fan base. I have employed a team of editors and
                artists to help with my workload and have begun working on the second novel. People have told me this book is unlike anything they have ever read before.
                I have managed to accurately portray and depict realistic and appropriate representation for many marginalized groups all while
                keeping the intrigue and drama alive. I have managed to have an action-packed book where the fight scenes are easily imagined and quite gory but in all the right ways.
                I have many sections where the drama and pain are palpable and my editor has told me many times that she has had to step away and recollect herself before continuing.
                This book has become something I am so very proud of and I plan on taking this book to heights I couldn't have imagined.</p>
